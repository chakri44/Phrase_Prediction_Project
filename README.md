# 🚀 Phrase Prediction Project  

A deep learning-based NLP model that predicts phrases during sentence formation using LSTM.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ NLP-based phrase prediction using LSTM.  
✅ Pre-trained model (`model2.h5`).  
✅ Flask web app for user interaction.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup  
1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chakri44/Phrase_Prediction_Project.git
cd Phrase_Prediction_Project
```
2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3️⃣ **Run the Application**  
```bash
python app.py
```

## 🔍 How It Works  
- The model is based on **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN).  
- It takes a sequence of words as input and predicts the **next phrase** based on learned patterns.  
- The **Flask API** allows users to enter a phrase and get real-time predictions.  

## 📡 API Usage  
- **Endpoint:** `POST /predict`  
- **Input Format:**  
```json
{
  "text": "The weather is"
}
```
- **Output Format:**  
```json
{
  "predicted_phrase": "nice and sunny"
}
```

## 📊 Model Training  
- The dataset was processed using **tokenization** and **embedding layers**.  
- The LSTM model was trained with **categorical cross-entropy loss** and **Adam optimizer**.  

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack  
🔹 Python (Flask, TensorFlow/Keras)  
🔹 NLP (Tokenization, Embedding, LSTM)  
🔹 Jupyter Notebooks (Model Training)
